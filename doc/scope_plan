## 3️⃣ Weekly Execution Plan (8-Week Build)

## Current Implementation Status (as of 2026-01-07)

This repo already implements the MVP backend contracts (FastAPI + Postgres) and an importable n8n workflow.

**Backend foundation**
* FastAPI app + SQLAlchemy models + Alembic migrations
* Postgres schema created via Alembic migration `0001` (enums + tables + indexes)
* Campaign slug support via migration `0002`
* Global Bearer API key auth on all `/api/*` routes

**API contracts (aligned to MVP envelopes/status codes)**
* Trends: `/api/trends/ingest`, `/api/trends/top` (ingest upserts items + inserts snapshots)
* Campaigns: `/api/campaigns` (create/list with `{items:[...]}`)
* Content: `/api/content/generate`, `/api/content/{id}/approve`, `/api/content/approved`
* Posts: `/api/posts/schedule`, `/api/posts/update-status`, `/api/posts/metrics`, `/api/posts/recent`
* Leads: `/api/leads/upsert`, `/api/leads` list (filters), `/api/leads/{id}/events|notes|tasks`, `/api/leads/{id}/score/recalculate`
* Handoff: `/api/handoff/create`, `/api/handoff/recent`

**n8n**
* W1 workflow exists and no longer references `/api/trends/fetch`; it uses a placeholder items node and calls `/api/trends/ingest`.

**Remaining gaps (next work)**
* W2 + W3 n8n workflows (approved content → scheduling; lead webhooks → CRM + handoff)
* Real trend collectors (replace placeholder items) and/or optional `/api/trends/fetch`
* Actual AI content generation (LLM integration) and approval UI (if desired)
* Publishing integration (manual publish is OK for MVP)

---

* Platform can evolve into a **sellable SaaS**

---

## Definition of Done (MVP)

The MVP is considered “ready” when the following are true:

* Backend can start cleanly and migrations apply successfully (`alembic upgrade head`).
* All `/api/*` endpoints require `Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>` and return `401` when missing/invalid.
* W1 workflow can run end-to-end and results in:
  * trend ingestion + snapshots recorded
  * campaigns created with slugs
  * content packs created (and retrievable via `/api/content/approved` once approved)
* W2 workflow can take approved content packs and create scheduled posts.
* W3 workflow can upsert leads, append events, recalculate score, and create handoffs for sales-ready leads.

### Next

Suggested next work items to keep momentum:
1) Create W2 + W3 n8n workflows for end-to-end automation
2) Replace placeholder trend items with a real collector (Google Trends / Reddit / YouTube)
3) Add a lightweight approval UI (optional) or keep approval in n8n
